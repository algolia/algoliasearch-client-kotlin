 * Click event after an Algolia request. Use this event to track when users click items in the
 * search results. If you're building your category pages with Algolia, you'll also use this event.
 *
 * @param eventName Event name, up to 64 ASCII characters. Consider naming events consistently—for
 *   example, by adopting Segment's
 *   [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework)
 *   framework.
 * @param eventType
 * @param index Index name (case-sensitive) to which the event's items belong.
 * @param objectIDs Object IDs of the records that are part of the event.
 * @param positions Position of the clicked item the search results. You must provide 1 `position`
 *   for each `objectID`.
 * @param queryID Unique identifier for a search query. The query ID is required for events related
 *   to search or browse requests. If you add `clickAnalytics: true` as a search request parameter,
 *   the query ID is included in the API response.
 * @param userToken Anonymous or pseudonymous user identifier. Don't use personally identifiable
 *   information in user tokens. For more information, see
 *   [User token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken).
 * @param authenticatedUserToken Identifier for authenticated users. When the user signs in, you can
 *   get an identifier from your system and send it as `authenticatedUserToken`. This lets you keep
 *   using the `userToken` from before the user signed in, while providing a reliable way to
 *   identify users across sessions. Don't use personally identifiable information in user tokens.
 *   For more information, see
 *   [User token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken).
 * @param timestamp Timestamp of the event, measured in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Must be
 *   no older than 30 days. If not provided, we use the time at which the request was received.
