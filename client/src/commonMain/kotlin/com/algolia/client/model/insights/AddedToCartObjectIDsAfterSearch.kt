/**
 * Use this event to track when users add items to their shopping cart after a previous Algolia request. If you're building your category pages with Algolia, you'll also use this event.
 *
 * @param eventName Event name, up to 64 ASCII characters.  Consider naming events consistently—for example, by adopting Segment's [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework) framework.
 * @param eventType
 * @param eventSubtype
 * @param index Index name (case-sensitive) to which the event's items belong.
 * @param queryID Unique identifier for a search query.  The query ID is required for events related to search or browse requests. If you add `clickAnalytics: true` as a search request parameter, the query ID is included in the API response.
 * @param objectIDs Object IDs of the records that are part of the event.
 * @param userToken Anonymous or pseudonymous user identifier.  Don't use personally identifiable information in user tokens. For more information, see [User token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken).
 * @param authenticatedUserToken Identifier for authenticated users.  When the user signs in, you can get an identifier from your system and send it as `authenticatedUserToken`. This lets you keep using the `userToken` from before the user signed in, while providing a reliable way to identify users across sessions. Don't use personally identifiable information in user tokens. For more information, see [User token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken).
 * @param currency Three-letter [currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html).
 * @param objectData Extra information about the records involved in a purchase or add-to-cart events.  If provided, it must be the same length as `objectIDs`.
 * @param timestamp Timestamp of the event, measured in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. By default, the Insights API uses the time it receives an event as its timestamp.
 * @param `value`
