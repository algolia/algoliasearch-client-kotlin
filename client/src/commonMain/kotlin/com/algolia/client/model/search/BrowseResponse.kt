/**
 * BrowseResponse
 *
 * @param hitsPerPage Number of hits per page.
 * @param nbHits Number of results (hits).
 * @param nbPages Number of pages of results.
 * @param page Page of search results to retrieve.
 * @param processingTimeMS Time the server took to process the request, in milliseconds.
 * @param hits Search results (hits).  Hits are records from your index that match the search criteria, augmented with additional attributes, such as, for highlighting.
 * @param query Search query.
 * @param params URL-encoded string of all search parameters.
 * @param abTestID A/B test ID. This is only included in the response for indices that are part of an A/B test.
 * @param abTestVariantID Variant ID. This is only included in the response for indices that are part of an A/B test.
 * @param aroundLatLng Computed geographical location.
 * @param automaticRadius Distance from a central coordinate provided by `aroundLatLng`.
 * @param exhaustive
 * @param exhaustiveFacetsCount See the `facetsCount` field of the `exhaustive` object in the response.
 * @param exhaustiveNbHits See the `nbHits` field of the `exhaustive` object in the response.
 * @param exhaustiveTypo See the `typo` field of the `exhaustive` object in the response.
 * @param facets Facet counts.
 * @param facetsStats Statistics for numerical facets.
 * @param index Index name used for the query.
 * @param indexUsed Index name used for the query. During A/B testing, the targeted index isn't always the index used by the query.
 * @param message Warnings about the query.
 * @param nbSortedHits Number of hits selected and sorted by the relevant sort algorithm.
 * @param parsedQuery Post-[normalization](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/optimize-search-results/handling-natural-languages-nlp/#what-does-normalization-mean) query string that will be searched.
 * @param processingTimingsMS Experimental. List of processing steps and their times, in milliseconds. You can use this list to investigate performance issues.
 * @param queryAfterRemoval Markup text indicating which parts of the original query have been removed to retrieve a non-empty result set.
 * @param redirect
 * @param renderingContent
 * @param serverTimeMS Time the server took to process the request, in milliseconds.
 * @param serverUsed Host name of the server that processed the request.
 * @param userData An object with custom data.  You can store up to 32kB as custom data.
 * @param queryID Unique identifier for the query. This is used for [click analytics](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/analytics/click-analytics/).
 * @param cursor Cursor to get the next page of the response.  The parameter must match the value returned in the response of a previous request. The last page of the response does not return a `cursor` attribute.
