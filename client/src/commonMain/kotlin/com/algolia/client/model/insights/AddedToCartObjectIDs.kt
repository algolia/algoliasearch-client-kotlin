/**
 * Use this event to track when users add items to their shopping cart unrelated to a previous
 * Algolia request. For example, if you don't use Algolia to build your category pages, use this
 * event. To track add-to-cart events related to Algolia requests, use the \"Added to cart object
 * IDs after search\" event.
 *
 * @param eventName Event name, up to 64 ASCII characters. Consider naming events consistently—for
 *   example, by adopting Segment's
 *   [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/#the-object-action-framework)
 *   framework.
 * @param eventType
 * @param eventSubtype
 * @param index Index name (case-sensitive) to which the event's items belong.
 * @param objectIDs Object IDs of the records that are part of the event.
 * @param userToken Anonymous or pseudonymous user identifier. Don't use personally identifiable
 *   information in user tokens. For more information, see
 *   [User token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken).
 * @param authenticatedUserToken Identifier for authenticated users. When the user signs in, you can
 *   get an identifier from your system and send it as `authenticatedUserToken`. This lets you keep
 *   using the `userToken` from before the user signed in, while providing a reliable way to
 *   identify users across sessions. Don't use personally identifiable information in user tokens.
 *   For more information, see
 *   [User token](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/sending-events/concepts/usertoken).
 * @param currency Three-letter [currency code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html).
 * @param objectData Extra information about the records involved in a purchase or add-to-cart
 *   event. If specified, it must have the same length as `objectIDs`.
 * @param timestamp Timestamp of the event, measured in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Must be
 *   no older than 30 days. If not provided, we use the time at which the request was received.
 * @param `value`
