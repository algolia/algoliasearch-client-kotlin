/**
 * Condition
 *
 * @param pattern Query pattern that triggers the rule. You can use either a literal string, or a
 *   special pattern `{facet:ATTRIBUTE}`, where `ATTRIBUTE` is a facet name. The rule is triggered
 *   if the query matches the literal string or a value of the specified facet. For example, with
 *   `pattern: {facet:genre}`, the rule is triggered when users search for a genre, such as
 *   \"comedy\".
 * @param anchoring
 * @param context An additional restriction that only triggers the rule, when the search has the
 *   same value as `ruleContexts` parameter. For example, if `context: mobile`, the rule is only
 *   triggered when the search request has a matching `ruleContexts: mobile`. A rule context must
 *   only contain alphanumeric characters.
 * @param filters Filters that trigger the rule. You can add add filters using the syntax
 *   `facet:value` so that the rule is triggered, when the specific filter is selected. You can use
 *   `filters` on its own or combine it with the `pattern` parameter.
 * @param sortBy Sort criteria that trigger the rule. You can trigger composition rules based on the
 *   selected sorting strategy set by the parameter `sortBy`. The rule will trigger if the value
 *   passed to `sortBy` matches the one defined in the condition.
