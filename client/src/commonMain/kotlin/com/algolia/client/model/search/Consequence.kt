/**

 *
 * @param params
 * @param promote Records you want to pin to a specific position in the search results. You can
 *   promote up to 300 records, either individually, or as groups of up to 100 records each.
 * @param filterPromotes Determines whether promoted records must also match active filters for the
 *   consequence to apply. This ensures user-applied filters take priority and irrelevant matches
 *   aren't shown. For example, if you promote a record with `color: red` but the user filters for
 *   `color: blue`, the \"red\" record won't be shown. > In the Algolia dashboard, when you use the
 *   **Pin an item** consequence, `filterPromotes` appears as the checkbox: **Pinned items must
 *   match active filters to be displayed.** For examples, see
 *   [Promote results with rules](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/rules/merchandising-and-promoting/how-to/promote-hits/#promote-results-matching-active-filters).
 * @param hide Records you want to hide from the search results.
 * @param userData A JSON object with custom data that will be appended to the `userData` array in
 *   the response. This object isn't interpreted by the API and is limited to 1&nbsp;kB of minified
