 * @param params
 * @param promote Records you want to pin to a specific position in the search results.  You can promote up to 300 records, either individually, or as groups of up to 100 records each.
 * @param filterPromotes Whether promoted records must match an active filter for the consequence to be applied.  This ensures that user actions (filtering the search) are given a higher precendence. For example, if you promote a record with the `color: red` attribute, and the user filters the search for `color: blue`, the \"red\" record won't be shown.
 * @param hide Records you want to hide from the search results.
 * @param userData A JSON object with custom data that will be appended to the `userData` array in the response. This object isn't interpreted by the API and is limited to 1&nbsp;kB of minified JSON.
